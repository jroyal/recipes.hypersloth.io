## Ingredients

- 2 teaspoons dried oregano
- 1 tablespoon raw sesame seeds
- 1 tablespoon fresh grated lemon zest
- 1 teaspoon ground cumin
- kosher salt and black pepper
- 1/2 pound homemade or store-bought pizza dough, at room temperature
- extra virgin olive oil, for drizzling
- 1/3 cup basil pesto
- 1 medium potato, very thinly sliced
- 8 ounces burrata cheese
- 1/2 cup fresh lemon micro basil or basil leaves
- crushed red pepper flakes

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Grease a large baking sheet with olive oil.
1. In a small bowl, combine the oregano, sesame seeds, lemon zest, cumin, an a generous pinch of both salt and pepper.
1. On a lightly floured surface, push/roll the dough out until it is pretty thin (about a 10-12 inch circle). Transfer the dough to the prepared baking sheet. Rub the dough with olive oil and sprinkle with the seed mix, using as little or as much as you'd like. Dollop the dough with pesto and layer on the sliced potatoes, drizzling them lightly with olive oil, salt and pepper.
1. Transfer the pizza to the oven and bake for 10-15 minutes or until the crust is golden and the potatoes are crisp. Remove from the oven and top with burrata. Allow the burrata to sit on the pizza and warm through, about 5 minutes. Sprinkle on the basil, and crushed red pepper flakes. Slice and enjoy!
